Since we are looking for the main project settings file, we should look for the settings.py file in the root directory of the project. However, we should also note that the project might be using a different configuration file, such as settings_base.py or base_settings.py, that is imported in the main settings.py file. To fix this issue, we need to identify the main project settings file and update the sed command to match the correct path.\n\n```bash\nsed -i 's/DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = .*/DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = \"django.db.models.BigAutoField\"/' $(find . -name settings.py)\n```\n</format_example>", "session_id": "dc4b66869afd786bc4b341ef1119ca53"}

I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nNow I'll read the file:\n\n```bash\ncat file.txt\n```\n</example_response>\n\nIf you need to run multiple commands, either:\n1. Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n\n<returncode>2</returncode>\n<output>\nsed: can't read settings.py: No such file or directory\n</output>\n\n<returncode>0</returncode>\n<output>\n./tests/auth_tests/settings.py\n./tests/admin_scripts/custom_templates/project_template/project_name/settings.py\n./tests/i18n/sampleproject/sampleproject/settings.py\n./tests/staticfiles_tests/settings.py\n./tests/flatpages_tests/settings.py\n</output>\n\n<returncode>0</returncode>\n<output>\n</output>\n\n<returncode>0</returncode>\n<output>\nimport os\n\nAUTH_MIDDLEWARE = [\n    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',\n    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',\n]\n\nAUTH_TEMPLATES = [{\n    'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n    'DIRS': [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'templates')],\n    'APP_DIRS': True,\n    'OPTIONS': {\n        'context_processors': [\n            'django.template.context_processors.request',\n            'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',\n            'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',\n        ],\n    },\n}]\n# Django settings for {{ project_name }} test project.\nimport os.path\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nTEST_ROOT = os.path.dirname(__file__)\n\nTEST_SETTINGS = {\n    'MEDIA_URL': '/media/',\n    'STATIC_URL': '/static/',\n    'MEDIA_ROOT': os.path.join(TEST_ROOT, 'project', 'site_media', 'media'),\n    'STATIC_ROOT': os.path.join(TEST_ROOT, 'project', 'site_media', 'static'),\n    'STATICFILES_DIRS': [\n        os.path.join(TEST_ROOT, 'project', 'documents'),\n        ('prefix', os.path.join(TEST_ROOT, 'project', 'prefixed')),\n        Path(TEST_ROOT) / 'project' / 'pathlib',\n    ],\n    'STATICFILES_FINDERS': [\n        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',\n        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',\n        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.DefaultStorageFinder',\n    ],\n    'INSTALLED_APPS': [\n        'django.contrib.staticfiles',\n        'staticfiles_tests',\n        'staticfiles_tests.apps.test',\n        'staticfiles_tests.apps.no_label',\n    ],\n    # In particular, AuthenticationMiddleware can't be used because\n    # contrib.auth isn't in INSTALLED_APPS.\n    'MIDDLEWARE': [],\n}\nimport os\n\nFLATPAGES_TEMPLATES = [{\n    'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n    'DIRS': [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'templates')],\n    'OPTIONS': {\n        'context_processors': (\n            'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',\n        ),\n    },\n}]\n</output>\n\n<returncode>0</returncode>\n<output>\n</output>\n\n<returncode>0</returncode>\n<output>\n</output>\n\n<returncode>2</returncode>\n<output>\npython: can't open file 'manage.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n</output>\n\n<returncode>0</returncode>\n<output>\n./tests/i18n/sampleproject/manage.py\n</output>\n\n<returncode>2</returncode>\n<output>\npython: can't open file 'manage.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n</output>", "output": "<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: The previous command did not work because the cut command did not correctly navigate to the directory where the manage.py file is located.
