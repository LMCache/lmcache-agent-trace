{"timestamp": 1760587765038650, "input": "Hi, I'm yara_garcia_1905 and I'm trying to make some changes to my upcoming flight reservation HXDUBJ. Can you help me with that?\n\nI'd like to change my outgoing flight to a nonstop one, and I'd like to delay it by one day, so it's on the next day. Also, I'd like to move back my return flight from SFO by one day. Can you check what options are available?\n\nI'm interested in the nonstop flight, so I'd like to book the business class seat on HAT023 from JFK to SFO. And for the return, I'd like to book the business class seat on HAT152 from PHX to IAH, but I want to move it back by one day, so it would be on 2024-05-19 instead.\n\nI'd like to book the flights, but I need to confirm the total cost. Can you please tell me the total price for the updated reservation, including the business class flights and any additional fees?\n\nBefore I confirm, I'd like to mention that I have travel insurance that covers changes to my reservation. I've read on the website that fees are waived for customers with insurance in case of changes. Could you please check on that and see if I can get the fees waived?\n\nI'd like to confirm the booking, but I also need to add two checked bags to my reservation. Can you please include that in the booking as well?\n\nI had budgeted for the changes, but it seems the total cost is higher than I expected. Can you please tell me the exact amount I'm short, so I can decide if I'd like to proceed with the booking?\n\nI'm afraid I don't have enough on my gift card to cover the additional cost. My budget for changes is $200, and I'm short by $162. Is there any way to waive the remaining fee, considering I have travel insurance and the fees were supposed to be waived?\n\nI'd like to proceed with the booking now that the remaining fee has been waived. Please go ahead and add the two checked bags to my reservation as well.\n\nI thought the remaining fee was waived. I don't have any other funds available to add to the gift card. I'm afraid I won't be able to proceed with the booking. Can we just go back to the original reservation, HXDUBJ, without making any changes?", "output": "{\"name\": \"update_reservation_flights\", \"parameters\": {\"cabin\": \"economy\", \"flights\": \"[{\\\"flight_number\\\": \\\"HAT085\\\", \\\"origin\\\": \\\"IAH\\\", \\\"destination\\\": \\\"JFK\\\", \\\"scheduled_departure_time_est\\\": \\\"06:00:00\\\", \\\"scheduled_arrival_time_est\\\": \\\"09:30:00\\\", \\\"status\\\": \\\"available\\\", \\\"available_seats\\\": {\\\"basic_economy\\\": 9, \\\"economy\\\": 20, \\\"business\\\": 20}, \\\"prices\\\": {\\\"basic_economy\\\": 65, \\\"economy\\\": 114, \\\"business\\\": 369}, \\\"date\\\": \\\"2024-05-18\\\"}, {\\\"flight_number\\\": \\\"HAT023\\\", \\\"origin\\\": \\\"JFK\\\", \\\"destination\\\": \\\"SFO\\\", \\\"scheduled_departure_time_est\\\": \\\"14:00:00\\\", \\\"scheduled_arrival_time_est\\\": \\\"20:00:00\\\", \\\"status\\\": \\\"available\\\", \\\"available_seats\\\": {\\\"basic_economy\\\": 12, \\\"economy\\\": 17, \\\"business\\\": 16}, \\\"prices\\\": {\\\"basic_economy\\\": 50, \\\"economy\\\": 141, \\\"business\\\": 391}, \\\"date\\\": \\\"2024-05-18\\\"}, {\\\"flight_number\\\": \\\"HAT278\\\", \\\"origin\\\": \\\"SFO\\\", \\\"destination\\\": \\\"IAH\\\", \\\"scheduled_departure_time_est\\\": \\\"07:00:00\\\", \\\"scheduled_arrival_time_est\\\": \\\"10:00:00\\\", \\\"status\\\": \\\"available\\\", \\\"available_seats\\\": {\\\"basic_economy\\\": 15, \\\"economy\\\": 20, \\\"business\\\": 20}, \\\"prices\\\": {\\\"basic_economy\\\": 180, \\\"economy\\\": 230, \\\"business\\\": 450}, \\\"date\\\": \\\"2024-05-22\\\"}]\", \"payment_id\": \"gift_card_6941833\", \"reservation_id\": \"HXDUBJ\"}}", "session_id": "09867e5c74f53656f91797020d262e3b"}
