I'm currently scheduled to fly out of JFK on May 17, but something's come up and I need to get back home sooner.\n\nI think you have my reservation details. I'd like to change my flight to a nonstop one, if possible, and I'm willing to pay a fee for the change, but I'd like to keep it under $100.\n\nI'm really in a tight spot here - my cat's not doing well and I need to get home as soon as possible. Can you see if there are any nonstop flights with available seats for the next few days? Maybe I can fly out earlier?\n\nWhat about flights on May 15th? I know it's even earlier, but I'm getting really worried about my cat and I'll do whatever it takes to get home sooner.\n\nOkay, so there aren't any nonstop flights available on the 15th or the 16th. What about flights that have the shortest layover possible? I'm still willing to pay the change fee, up to $100.\n\nAt this point, I'd be happy with a flight that has the shortest layover, even if it's not a one-stop flight.

I'll take anything at this point.\n\nI don't have time to wait for you to keep searching. Can you just book me on the best available flight, even if it's not nonstop, and I'll worry about the change fee later?\n\nThis flight from ATL to MCO looks like it's available on the 16th, but I still need to get from JFK to ATL.
