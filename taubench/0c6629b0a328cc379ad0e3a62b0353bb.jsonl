Can you let me know if that's possible and what the total cost would be?\n\nThat's just one certificate, I have another one that's larger, so I'd like to use that one instead if possible. And can you also tell me what time the flights depart?\n\nI'd like to use my credit card as the second payment method if needed, specifically my card with the number 7447. Also, can you confirm that the flights are direct or if they have a stopover?\n\nI don't see the departure times for the flights, and I also want to make sure that they depart after 11am EST. Can you give me more information about the flight schedules?\n\nI'd like to see the actual flight schedules, including the departure and arrival times, and also the layover time if there's a stopover.\n\nI don't see any information about the departure times, so I'm going to assume that the flights don't meet my requirement of departing after 11am EST. Can you provide me with some alternative flight options that do meet this requirement?\n\nI'd like to cancel my current reservation because none of the flights meet my requirements.", "output": "", "session_id": "0c6629b0a328cc379ad0e3a62b0353bb"}
