It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n- The request asks for the number of papers about CRISPR/Cas9 in 2023.  \n- The result must be rounded up to the closest 1000.  \n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n- The exact number of CRISPR/Cas9-related publications in 2023, specifically from major databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, or Google Scholar.  \n- Filters must be applied to ensure only 2023 publications are counted, and the topic is precisely “CRISPR/Cas9” (not broader CRISPR or Cas-related topics).  \n- Authoritative sources:  \n  - PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) — use search filters for publication year 2023 and MeSH term “CRISPR-Cas Systems” or keyword “CRISPR/Cas9”.  \n  - Web of Science Core Collection (https://www.webofscience.com/) — search in “SCI-EXPANDED” or “SCIE” with “CRISPR/Cas9” and year 2023.  \n  - Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/) — search with “TITLE-ABS-KEY (CRISPR/Cas9) AND PUBYEAR = 2023”.  \n  - Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) — search “CRISPR/Cas9 2023” with “since 2023” filter, though less authoritative for exact counts.  \n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n- None. The number is a direct count from databases; no computation or deduction is needed beyond extracting and rounding the raw figure.  \n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n- Based on trends: CRISPR/Cas9 research output has grown exponentially since 2015, with ~10,000+ papers in 2022 (per PubMed).  \n- 2023 likely exceeded 15,000 papers — possibly 16,000–18,000 — due to continued high interest and new applications.  \n- Rounded up to the nearest 1000: 20,000.  \n- This is a well-reasoned guess based on growth curves and institutional publishing rates, but not definitive without actual data.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Use WebSurfer to search PubMed or Web of Science for exact count of “CRISPR/Cas9” papers published in 2023.\n- Filter results by year 2023 and retrieve total count from the search results page.\n- If exact number not available or too granular, use WebSurfer to search Scopus or Google Scholar with similar filters.\n- Round the retrieved number up to the nearest 1000.\n- Return the final rounded number as the answer.\n- Coder and ComputerTerminal not required — no computation or scripting needed beyond retrieval and rounding.\n\nassistant: WebSurfer, please navigate to https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and search for 'CRISPR/Cas9' with the publication year filter set to 2023.
