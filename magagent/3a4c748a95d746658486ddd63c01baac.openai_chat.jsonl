GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n- The request asks for the number of papers about CRISPR/Cas9 in 2023.  \n- The final answer must be rounded up to the closest 1000.  \n- The request does not provide any specific numbers, dates, or sources.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n- Total number of peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2023 that mention “CRISPR/Cas9” in their title, abstract, or keywords.  \n  → Source: PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) — search for “CRISPR/Cas9” with publication year 2023.  \n  → Alternative: Web of Science, Scopus, or Google Scholar with filters for 2023.  \n  → Official databases like the National Library of Medicine (NLM) or Crossref may also provide aggregate counts.  \n- If PubMed is the most authoritative source for biomedical literature, it should be prioritized.  \n- Filters must include: publication year = 2023, and search term = “CRISPR/Cas9” (exact phrase or variations).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n- None required. The number is a direct count from a database, and rounding up to the nearest 1000 is a simple arithmetic step.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n- CRISPR/Cas9 is one of the most researched topics in molecular biology, with over 10,000 papers published in 2022 alone (based on PubMed estimates).  \n- Assuming a 10–15% increase in 2023, the total may be approximately 11,000–13,500.  \n- However, this is a rough estimate and should not be relied upon without actual data.  \n- The actual number may be slightly lower if many papers are in non-English journals or preprints not indexed in PubMed.  \n- The request’s rounding instruction suggests the number is likely in the 10,000–15,000 range, so rounding up to 10,000 or 20,000 is plausible — but only after verification.\n\nuser: Fantastic.

Check the execution result returned by the user.\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n- The request asks for the number of papers about CRISPR/Cas9 in 2023.  \n- The final answer must be rounded up to the closest 1000.  \n- The request does not provide any specific numbers, dates, or sources.\n\n2.

{"timestamp": 1760996099163062, "input": "assistant: We are working to address the following user request:\n\nHow many papers about CRISPR/Cas9 can be found in 2023? Round up to the closest 1000.\n\n\nTo answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n- The request asks for the number of papers about CRISPR/Cas9 in 2023.  \n- The final answer must be rounded up to the closest 1000.  \n- The request does not provide any specific numbers, dates, or sources.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n- Total number of peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2023 that mention “CRISPR/Cas9” in their title, abstract, or keywords.  \n  → Source: PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) — search for “CRISPR/Cas9” with publication year 2023.  \n  → Alternative: Web of Science, Scopus, or Google Scholar with filters for 2023.  \n  → Official databases like the National Library of Medicine (NLM) or Crossref may also provide aggregate counts.  \n- If PubMed is the most authoritative source for biomedical literature, it should be prioritized.  \n- Filters must include: publication year = 2023, and search term = “CRISPR/Cas9” (exact phrase or variations).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n- None required. The number is a direct count from a database, and rounding up to the nearest 1000 is a simple arithmetic step.\n\n4.
