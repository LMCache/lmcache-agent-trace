GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n- The request asks for the title of a paper discussing the genetics of blue eye color in cats.  \n- The paper was published in 2024.  \n- A relevant 2024 paper titled “Different founding effects underlie dominant blue eyes (DBE) in the domestic cat” has been identified and appears to discuss the genetics of blue eye color in cats.  \n  → Published in *Animals* (MDPI), 2024.  \n  → Authors: M Abitbol, C Dufaure de Citres, G Rudd Garces, et al.  \n  → Abstract indicates it discusses genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying blue eyes in cats.  \n  → This appears to be the most direct match to the query.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n- Specific title of the 2024 paper on feline blue eye color genetics.  \n  → Confirmed: “Different founding effects underlie dominant blue eyes (DBE) in the domestic cat” (MDPI, 2024) is a strong candidate.  \n  → Other 2024 papers on feline blue eyes include:  \n    • “A PAX3 insertion in the Celestial breed and certain feline breeding lines with dominant blue eyes” (Wiley, 2024)  \n    • “PAX3 haploinsufficiency in Maine Coon cats with dominant blue eyes and hearing loss resembling the human Waardenburg syndrome” (OUP, 2024)  \n  → These may be more specialized or breed-specific, but they also discuss genetics of blue eyes.  \n  → Searchable via PubMed, Google Scholar, or institutional library databases using keywords: “blue eye color cat genetics 2024” or “feline eye color genetics 2024”.  \n  → May also be found in press releases from institutions like the University of California, Davis, or the Broad Institute if they authored it.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n- None required. The request provides sufficient specificity (subject + year) to directly locate the paper.  \n  → However, multiple papers exist on this topic in 2024, so the most appropriate one must be selected based on scope and relevance.  \n  → The paper “Different founding effects underlie dominant blue eyes (DBE) in the domestic cat” appears to be the most comprehensive and general, discussing blue eyes across the domestic cat population rather than a specific breed.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n- The paper “Different founding effects underlie dominant blue eyes (DBE) in the domestic cat” (MDPI, 2024) is the most likely answer to the request.  \n  → Reasoning: It directly addresses the genetics of blue eye color in cats (not just a specific breed), was published in 2024, and is published in a reputable journal (MDPI Animals).  \n  → Other papers (e.g., PAX3 in Celestial or Maine Coon cats) are more specialized and may not be as broadly relevant to “blue eye color in cats” as a whole.  \n  → This is a strong educated guess based on the available data, and should be verified by accessing the full text or abstract to confirm it fully addresses the topic.  \n  → Alternative educated guess: If the request is seeking a paper on a specific breed (e.g., Maine Coon or Celestial), then the PAX3-related papers may be more appropriate, but the query does not specify a breed.\n\nNote: The search results indicate that multiple 2024 papers exist on feline blue eye color genetics, but “Different founding effects underlie dominant blue eyes (DBE) in the domestic cat” appears to be the most comprehensive and directly relevant to the general topic. This educated guess is now supported by evidence and should be prioritized for verification.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n**What went wrong:**  \nThe repeated failure to open the target paper’s page stemmed from an inability to click the link due to a persistent UI state — likely a browser or session issue — and the fact that we were stuck on the Google Scholar results page without successfully navigating to the full article.
