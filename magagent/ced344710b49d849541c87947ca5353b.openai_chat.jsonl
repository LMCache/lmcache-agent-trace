FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Current Google Reviews data (ratings and review counts) for wedding venues in Orange County, specifically those with ocean views and guest seating.\n- Official or third-party listings (e.g., WeddingWire, The Knot, Zola, or local directories) to verify which venues are “primarily wedding venues” and not clubs or museums.\n- Specific venue names and their exact ocean-view ceremony capabilities (e.g., whether the ocean view is obstructed, limited to certain times of day, or requires specific setup).\n- Verification of whether venues meet the “minimum 50 Google reviews” threshold and whether their ratings are at least 4.5.\n\n3.
