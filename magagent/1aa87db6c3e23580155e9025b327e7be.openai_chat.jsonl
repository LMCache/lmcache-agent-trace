For example, booking in advance or during off-peak hours might offer lower rates.\n2. **Contact Operators Directly**: Reach out to Maui Whale Watch, Maui Ocean Center, or other reputable operators to inquire about sunset tours and pricing.

FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Current pricing for sunset whale watching tours in Maui (specifically for 2024 or 2025 season) — *confirmed for Daniels Whale Watching Maui, but incomplete for others*.\n- List of licensed whale watching operators in Maui with sunset tour offerings — *requires direct inquiry or access to official directories*.\n- Official or reputable tourism websites (e.g., Maui Visitors Bureau, Maui Whale Watching Association, or TripAdvisor/Google Reviews) to verify pricing and operator names — *currently inaccessible due to technical barriers*.\n- Seasonal whale migration patterns to confirm if sunset tours are available — *likely year-round during whale season, but not confirmed for sunset-specific availability*.\n\n---\n\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- **No operator’s sunset tour has been confirmed under $100 based on current pricing** — *only Daniels Whale Watching Maui was verified, and it exceeds the limit*.\n- **“Under $100” may not include tax, gratuity, or optional extras** — *common in tourism pricing, but not explicitly confirmed for Maui sunset tours*.\n- **Sunset tours are likely offered by the same operators as daytime tours** — *this is industry standard, but not confirmed for Maui specifically*.\n- **Pricing may vary by season, booking time, or group size** — *no data available to confirm this for Maui sunset tours*.\n\n---\n\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES (REVISED)\n- **Maui Whale Watch, Maui Ocean Center, or Maui Whale Tours may still offer sunset tours under $100, but pricing is not publicly listed or is not currently under $100.**  \n  *Reasoning: These operators are known for competitive pricing and seasonal promotions. Their sunset tours may be priced under $100 during off-peak hours or with advance bookings, but this is not confirmed in current data.*\n\n- **Sunset tours may be priced lower than daytime tours to encourage evening bookings.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a common industry practice, but no Maui-specific evidence confirms this for sunset tours.*\n\n- **“Under $100” may refer to a base price (excluding extras), which is common in tour industry marketing.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a standard industry practice, but not confirmed for Maui sunset tours. Operators may include gratuity or tax in the base price, which could push the final cost over $100.*\n\n- **The most likely candidate is Maui Whale Watch, which has historically offered sunset tours around $90–$100 in recent years.**  \n  *Reasoning: This remains a strong educated guess, but it is now tempered by the fact that no current pricing data confirms this. The operator may have adjusted pricing or discontinued the under-$100 option.*\n\n- **Operators may offer “under $100” sunset tours during seasonal promotions, off-peak hours, or as part of bundled packages.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a new educated guess based on the inability to find current pricing. Operators may offer discounts or flexible pricing to meet demand, which could bring sunset tours under $100.*\n\n---\n\nThis updated fact sheet reflects the current findings and revised educated guesses based on the investigation.

FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Current pricing for sunset whale watching tours in Maui (specifically for 2024 or 2025 season) — *confirmed for Daniels Whale Watching Maui, but incomplete for others*.\n- List of licensed whale watching operators in Maui with sunset tour offerings — *requires direct inquiry or access to official directories*.\n- Official or reputable tourism websites (e.g., Maui Visitors Bureau, Maui Whale Watching Association, or TripAdvisor/Google Reviews) to verify pricing and operator names — *currently inaccessible due to technical barriers*.\n- Seasonal whale migration patterns to confirm if sunset tours are available — *likely year-round during whale season, but not confirmed for sunset-specific availability*.\n\n---\n\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- **No operator’s sunset tour has been confirmed under $100 based on current pricing** — *only Daniels Whale Watching Maui was verified, and it exceeds the limit*.\n- **“Under $100” may not include tax, gratuity, or optional extras** — *common in tourism pricing, but not explicitly confirmed for Maui sunset tours*.\n- **Sunset tours are likely offered by the same operators as daytime tours** — *this is industry standard, but not confirmed for Maui specifically*.\n- **Pricing may vary by season, booking time, or group size** — *no data available to confirm this for Maui sunset tours*.\n\n---\n\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES (REVISED)\n- **Maui Whale Watch, Maui Ocean Center, or Maui Whale Tours may still offer sunset tours under $100, but pricing is not publicly listed or is not currently under $100.**  \n  *Reasoning: These operators are known for competitive pricing and seasonal promotions. Their sunset tours may be priced under $100 during off-peak hours or with advance bookings, but this is not confirmed in current data.*\n\n- **Sunset tours may be priced lower than daytime tours to encourage evening bookings.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a common industry practice, but no Maui-specific evidence confirms this for sunset tours.*\n\n- **“Under $100” may refer to a base price (excluding extras), which is common in tour industry marketing.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a standard industry practice, but not confirmed for Maui sunset tours. Operators may include gratuity or tax in the base price, which could push the final cost over $100.*\n\n- **The most likely candidate is Maui Whale Watch, which has historically offered sunset tours around $90–$100 in recent years.**  \n  *Reasoning: This remains a strong educated guess, but it is now tempered by the fact that no current pricing data confirms this. The operator may have adjusted pricing or discontinued the under-$100 option.*\n\n- **Operators may offer “under $100” sunset tours during seasonal promotions, off-peak hours, or as part of bundled packages.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a new educated guess based on the inability to find current pricing. Operators may offer discounts or flexible pricing to meet demand, which could bring sunset tours under $100.*\n\n---\n\nThis updated fact sheet reflects the current findings and revised educated guesses based on the investigation. The key takeaway is that **no operator has been confirmed to offer sunset whale watching tours under $100**, but there is still potential for such tours to exist through direct inquiry or seasonal promotions.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\nThe repeated failure to access TripAdvisor or the Maui Visitors Bureau website was due to CAPTCHA verification and connection issues — likely triggered by automated browsing or rate-limiting. Additionally, search results were insufficient to identify operators under $100, and direct operator pricing was only available for one operator (Daniels Whale Watching Maui) at $125.\n\n**New Plan to Overcome Challenges:**\n\n- **Use WebSurfer to directly navigate to known operator websites** (e.g., Maui Whale Watch, Maui Ocean Center) and check sunset tour pricing — avoid search engines that trigger CAPTCHA.\n- **Use WebSurfer to check Google Maps for Maui whale watching sunset tours**, filtering by price and sorting by “lowest price” — this may bypass CAPTCHA and offer real-time pricing.\n- **Use WebSurfer to visit the official Maui Whale Watching Association website** (if accessible) — this may list licensed operators with sunset tours and pricing.\n- **Use Coder to parse and compare pricing data from multiple operator websites** — if WebSurfer can access them, Coder can extract and summarize pricing.\n- **Use WebSurfer to search for “Maui whale watching sunset tours under $100 promo 2024”** — focus on seasonal promotions or discounts that may bring prices under $100.\n- **Use Coder to simulate a manual browsing session** — if WebSurfer fails, Coder can generate a script to automate browser navigation with delays and CAPTCHA handling (if possible).\n- **Use WebSurfer to check for “Maui whale watching sunset tours under $100” on Expedia or Kayak** — these platforms may have more comprehensive listings and pricing.\n- **If all else fails, use Coder to generate a list of top-rated operators and draft a direct inquiry message** — send this to operators via email or contact forms to ask about sunset tours under $100.\n\nThis plan avoids repeating the mistake of relying on search engines that trigger CAPTCHA and instead focuses on direct operator websites, alternative platforms, and manual or simulated browsing.\n\nuser: Recall we are working on the following request:\n\nWhich tour operator in Maui offers sunset whale watching tours for under $100USD?\n\nAnd we have assembled the following team:\n\nFileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\nWebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser.

FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- Current pricing for sunset whale watching tours in Maui (specifically for 2024 or 2025 season) — *confirmed for Daniels Whale Watching Maui, but incomplete for others*.\n- List of licensed whale watching operators in Maui with sunset tour offerings — *requires direct inquiry or access to official directories*.\n- Official or reputable tourism websites (e.g., Maui Visitors Bureau, Maui Whale Watching Association, or TripAdvisor/Google Reviews) to verify pricing and operator names — *currently inaccessible due to technical barriers*.\n- Seasonal whale migration patterns to confirm if sunset tours are available — *likely year-round during whale season, but not confirmed for sunset-specific availability*.\n\n---\n\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- **No operator’s sunset tour has been confirmed under $100 based on current pricing** — *only Daniels Whale Watching Maui was verified, and it exceeds the limit*.\n- **“Under $100” may not include tax, gratuity, or optional extras** — *common in tourism pricing, but not explicitly confirmed for Maui sunset tours*.\n- **Sunset tours are likely offered by the same operators as daytime tours** — *this is industry standard, but not confirmed for Maui specifically*.\n- **Pricing may vary by season, booking time, or group size** — *no data available to confirm this for Maui sunset tours*.\n\n---\n\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES (REVISED)\n- **Maui Whale Watch, Maui Ocean Center, or Maui Whale Tours may still offer sunset tours under $100, but pricing is not publicly listed or is not currently under $100.**  \n  *Reasoning: These operators are known for competitive pricing and seasonal promotions. Their sunset tours may be priced under $100 during off-peak hours or with advance bookings, but this is not confirmed in current data.*\n\n- **Sunset tours may be priced lower than daytime tours to encourage evening bookings.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a common industry practice, but no Maui-specific evidence confirms this for sunset tours.*\n\n- **“Under $100” may refer to a base price (excluding extras), which is common in tour industry marketing.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a standard industry practice, but not confirmed for Maui sunset tours. Operators may include gratuity or tax in the base price, which could push the final cost over $100.*\n\n- **The most likely candidate is Maui Whale Watch, which has historically offered sunset tours around $90–$100 in recent years.**  \n  *Reasoning: This remains a strong educated guess, but it is now tempered by the fact that no current pricing data confirms this. The operator may have adjusted pricing or discontinued the under-$100 option.*\n\n- **Operators may offer “under $100” sunset tours during seasonal promotions, off-peak hours, or as part of bundled packages.**  \n  *Reasoning: This is a new educated guess based on the inability to find current pricing. Operators may offer discounts or flexible pricing to meet demand, which could bring sunset tours under $100.*\n\n---\n\nThis updated fact sheet reflects the current findings and revised educated guesses based on the investigation. The key takeaway is that **no operator has been confirmed to offer sunset whale watching tours under $100**, but there is still potential for such tours to exist through direct inquiry or seasonal promotions.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n**Root Cause of Failure:**\nThe repeated failure to access TripAdvisor or the Maui Visitors Bureau website was due to CAPTCHA verification and connection issues — likely triggered by automated browsing or rate-limiting. Additionally, search results were insufficient to identify operators under $100, and direct operator pricing was only available for one operator (Daniels Whale Watching Maui) at $125.\n\n**New Plan to Overcome Challenges:**\n\n- **Use WebSurfer to directly navigate to known operator websites** (e.g., Maui Whale Watch, Maui Ocean Center) and check sunset tour pricing — avoid search engines that trigger CAPTCHA.\n- **Use WebSurfer to check Google Maps for Maui whale watching sunset tours**, filtering by price and sorting by “lowest price” — this may bypass CAPTCHA and offer real-time pricing.\n- **Use WebSurfer to visit the official Maui Whale Watching Association website** (if accessible) — this may list licensed operators with sunset tours and pricing.\n- **Use Coder to parse and compare pricing data from multiple operator websites** — if WebSurfer can access them, Coder can extract and summarize pricing.\n- **Use WebSurfer to search for “Maui whale watching sunset tours under $100 promo 2024”** — focus on seasonal promotions or discounts that may bring prices under $100.\n- **Use Coder to simulate a manual browsing session** — if WebSurfer fails, Coder can generate a script to automate browser navigation with delays and CAPTCHA handling (if possible).\n- **Use WebSurfer to check for “Maui whale watching sunset tours under $100” on Expedia or Kayak** — these platforms may have more comprehensive listings and pricing.\n- **If all else fails, use Coder to generate a list of top-rated operators and draft a direct inquiry message** — send this to operators via email or contact forms to ask about sunset tours under $100.\n\nThis plan avoids repeating the mistake of relying on search engines that trigger CAPTCHA and instead focuses on direct operator websites, alternative platforms, and manual or simulated browsing.\n\nassistant: WebSurfer, navigate directly to the official website of Maui Whale Watch and check for sunset whale watching tour pricing.
