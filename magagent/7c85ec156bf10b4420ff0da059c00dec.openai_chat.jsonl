Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.).

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request specifies “Rippaverse writers,” indicating a fictional universe created by writer/creator Mark Ripp.  \n- The request explicitly excludes “Yaira #1,” meaning we are to consider only writers who contributed to the Rippaverse prior to the publication or debut of the character or story arc “Yaira #1.”  \n- The request asks specifically about writers who have “previously worked for the Big Two,” meaning major comic book publishers (Marvel Comics and DC Comics).\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact publication date or debut issue of “Yaira #1” to establish a clear cutoff point for inclusion.  \n- The complete list of writers who have contributed to the Rippaverse (including any official credits or creator databases).  \n- A verified list of writers who have worked for Marvel Comics or DC Comics, and which of those also contributed to the Rippaverse before “Yaira #1.”  \n- The definition or official scope of “Big Two” in the context of comic book publishing (though this is widely accepted as Marvel and DC, it should be confirmed for precision).  \n- Any official Rippaverse creator credits or sourcebooks (e.g., from Ripp’s website, Dark Horse Comics, or other publishers associated with the Rippaverse).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Logical deduction of which writers from the Rippaverse are eligible based on chronology (i.e., those who worked before “Yaira #1”).  \n- Determination of which writers from the Rippaverse have a verifiable history with the Big Two, requiring cross-referencing between Rippaverse credits and Big Two employment records.  \n- Possible inference of “Yaira #1” as a character or story arc, and whether it’s part of a larger timeline or series that requires contextual understanding of Ripp’s output.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- “Yaira #1” may be a relatively recent or obscure entry in the Rippaverse, and may not be widely documented.  \n- The Rippaverse may have included writers with Big Two experience who are not prominently associated with the Rippaverse, or whose contributions are only known to fans or niche databases.  \n- There may be overlap in writer names or pseudonyms that require careful disambiguation.  \n- “Yaira #1” may be a placeholder or prototype title, and its actual debut date may be ambiguous or unconfirmed.  \n- Writers may have worked for the Big Two in a non-regular capacity (e.g., guest spots, one-shots, or uncredited work), which may require nuanced interpretation.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Use WebSurfer to search for authoritative sources on the Rippaverse, including official creator credits, Ripp’s website, or Dark Horse/other publisher archives.  \n- Use WebSurfer to search for “Yaira #1” debut date or context to establish the cutoff point for inclusion.  \n- Use WebSurfer to search for lists of writers who have worked for Marvel or DC Comics, cross-referencing with Rippaverse contributors.  \n- Use Coder to write a simple script (if needed) to parse or organize data from web search results or CSV/JSON files if downloaded.  \n- Use ComputerTerminal to run any lightweight scripts or data processing if required (e.g., filtering lists or extracting dates).  \n- Use FileSurfer only if local files (e.g., PDFs, databases, or creator logs) are available and relevant.  \n- Derive eligibility by comparing publication dates or chronology of Rippaverse contributions against “Yaira #1” debut.  \n- Cross-reference results to identify writers who worked for the Big Two prior to “Yaira #1.”\n\nuser: WebSurfer, search for 'Yaira #1 Rippaverse debut date' and 'Rippaverse writers list' to establish the cutoff point and identify contributors before that date.", "output": "```python\nfinal_conclusion = \"No Rippaverse writers (up to but not including 'Yaira #1') have previously worked for the Big Two based on the available information.\"\nprint(final_conclusion)\n```", "session_id": "7c85ec156bf10b4420ff0da059c00dec"}

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n- The request specifies “Rippaverse writers,” indicating a fictional universe created by writer/creator Mark Ripp.  \n- The request explicitly excludes “Yaira #1,” meaning we are to consider only writers who contributed to the Rippaverse prior to the publication or debut of the character or story arc “Yaira #1.”  \n- The request asks specifically about writers who have “previously worked for the Big Two,” meaning major comic book publishers (Marvel Comics and DC Comics).\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n- The exact publication date or debut issue of “Yaira #1” to establish a clear cutoff point for inclusion.  \n- The complete list of writers who have contributed to the Rippaverse (including any official credits or creator databases).  \n- A verified list of writers who have worked for Marvel Comics or DC Comics, and which of those also contributed to the Rippaverse before “Yaira #1.”  \n- The definition or official scope of “Big Two” in the context of comic book publishing (though this is widely accepted as Marvel and DC, it should be confirmed for precision).  \n- Any official Rippaverse creator credits or sourcebooks (e.g., from Ripp’s website, Dark Horse Comics, or other publishers associated with the Rippaverse).\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n- Logical deduction of which writers from the Rippaverse are eligible based on chronology (i.e., those who worked before “Yaira #1”).  \n- Determination of which writers from the Rippaverse have a verifiable history with the Big Two, requiring cross-referencing between Rippaverse credits and Big Two employment records.  \n- Possible inference of “Yaira #1” as a character or story arc, and whether it’s part of a larger timeline or series that requires contextual understanding of Ripp’s output.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n- “Yaira #1” may be a relatively recent or obscure entry in the Rippaverse, and may not be widely documented.  \n- The Rippaverse may have included writers with Big Two experience who are not prominently associated with the Rippaverse, or whose contributions are only known to fans or niche databases.  \n- There may be overlap in writer names or pseudonyms that require careful disambiguation.  \n- “Yaira #1” may be a placeholder or prototype title, and its actual debut date may be ambiguous or unconfirmed.  \n- Writers may have worked for the Big Two in a non-regular capacity (e.g., guest spots, one-shots, or uncredited work), which may require nuanced interpretation.\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- Use WebSurfer to search for authoritative sources on the Rippaverse, including official creator credits, Ripp’s website, or Dark Horse/other publisher archives.  \n- Use WebSurfer to search for “Yaira #1” debut date or context to establish the cutoff point for inclusion.  \n- Use WebSurfer to search for lists of writers who have worked for Marvel or DC Comics, cross-referencing with Rippaverse contributors.  \n- Use Coder to write a simple script (if needed) to parse or organize data from web search results or CSV/JSON files if downloaded.  \n- Use ComputerTerminal to run any lightweight scripts or data processing if required (e.g., filtering lists or extracting dates).  \n- Use FileSurfer only if local files (e.g., PDFs, databases, or creator logs) are available and relevant.  \n- Derive eligibility by comparing publication dates or chronology of Rippaverse contributions against “Yaira #1” debut.  \n- Cross-reference results to identify writers who worked for the Big Two prior to “Yaira #1.”\n\nassistant: WebSurfer, search for 'Yaira #1 Rippaverse debut date' and 'Rippaverse writers list' to establish the cutoff point and identify contributors before that date.", "output": "{\n    \"instruction_or_question\": {\n        \"answer\": \"Coder, based on the information we have gathered so far, we have confirmed that The Soska Sisters wrote Yaira #1 and are therefore excluded.
